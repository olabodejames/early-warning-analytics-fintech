This capstone project develops an early-warning analytics framework for financial inclusion risk, with a specific application to Nigeria’s financial ecosystem and broader relevance to Sub-Saharan Africa.

This capstone project develops an early-warning analytics framework for financial inclusion risk, with a specific application to Nigeria’s financial ecosystem and broader relevance to Sub-Saharan Africa. The study addresses the persistent challenge of identifying, monitoring, and mitigating systemic risks that undermine access to formal financial services, particularly for underserved populations.

Using measurable, ethically sourced financial and socio-economic data, the project integrates statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and classification-based early-warning techniques to detect emerging stress signals that precede exclusion outcomes—such as account dormancy, credit disengagement, or service withdrawal. The analytic approach combines descriptive analysis, forecasting models, and classification metrics (e.g., precision, recall, ROC-AUC, calibration scores) to ensure both interpretability and decision relevance.

The research is structured around clearly defined research questions, each supported by transparent sample-size justification, a comprehensive data dictionary, and reproducible analysis pipelines. Emphasis is placed on practical feasibility, ensuring the project can be completed within a 10-week capstone timeline and deployed using commonly available data science tools.

From an applied perspective, the outputs are designed to support policymakers, financial institutions, fintech operators, and regulators by providing actionable insights that enable proactive intervention rather than reactive policy responses. The framework offers a scalable blueprint that can be adapted across emerging markets to strengthen financial stability, promote inclusive growth, and support evidence-based economic development strategies.
